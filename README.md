### Python Week 1 - Code Challenge Overview
# This code challenge encompasses the creation of solutions for three specific tasks, outlined below.

## Project Initialization

1.Establish a new project directory.
2.Formulate a new GitHub repository.
3.Commit regularly to the repository.
4.Incorporate a README.md file for documentation.
5.Include a license file, preferably the MIT license.
6.Organize Python solutions within a lib folder.
## Challenge 1: 12-hour to 24-hour Time Conversion
This code tackles the challenge of converting a time format from 12-hour to 24-hour. The function receives an hour (ranging from 1 to 12), a minute (ranging from 0 to 59), and a period ("am" or "pm") as inputs. It then returns a four-digit string representing the time in 24-hour format.

Function Overview
The convert_12hr_to_24hr(hour, minute, period) function performs the conversion, handling scenarios such as transitioning "pm" times to their 24-hour equivalents. The function ensures the output string consistently includes two digits for hours and minutes.



## Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive
This code addresses the challenge of determining whether exactly two out of three given integers are positive numbers.

Function Overview
The two_positive_numbers(a, b, c) function takes three integers as arguments and returns True if precisely two of them are positive. Otherwise, it returns False.



##Challenge 3: Consonant value
This code solves the challenge of finding the highest value of consonant substrings in a given lowercase string. Consonants are defined as any letters excluding "aeiou," and their values are assigned (a = 1, b = 2, ..., z = 26).

Function Overview
The consonant_value_calculation(word) function takes a lowercase string with alphabetic characters and returns the highest value among its consonant substrings.
